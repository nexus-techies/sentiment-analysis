												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

												"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"0": "VFM Flagship phone from Samsung",
												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it.

												"0": "Good mid- ranger phone",
												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

												"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"0": "VFM Flagship phone from Samsung",
												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"1": "I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket. I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone. Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k. All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price. And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents. Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup. For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed. Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare \"warming\" from this phone. One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option. I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India. For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day. P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you. In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake. P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well!

												"1": "In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion. I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.",

												"1": "After researching for months to replace my old workhorse MotoZ2force, I zeroed in samsung s20fe(exonys). But was vary of the processor. So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued. However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford. So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly. After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k. I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering. It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time. The camera quality is good, see some samples. The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot. The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it. Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations. Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference. Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all. I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time. Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other. If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also. Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life. Call me old fashioned buy I am more than Ok with slow charging.",

												"1": "I have used for 3 days. I love its blazing fast performance. Display is crispy & vivid color it is the main attraction. Camera is mindblowing. Nightmode feature surprised me. Gaming performance is also awesome. This phone has also Dolby sound system that amaze me. Both side has speaker so its produces 3d like sound. It has Bixby assistant. Google assistant and bixby assistant both are very accurate to capture my voice commands. Fingerprint sensor is also fast and accurate. Ui experience is so cool. I personally like samsung keyboard. This phone has AR zone app. You can play with augmented reality models. And much more. Only one cons - Battery life is average. Samsung is popular for their brand value, reliability and customer support. I will never blame my decision to chose between oneplus 9/9R and this phone. Finally I can say, I am fully satisfied with this phone.",

While initiating and data transfer, did get a little hot but nothing post that. Most of the time is spent on calling including Whatsapp (3-4 hours) and watching serials (5-6) hours and general net surfing (2-3 hours). Once charged in the morning, till night still 30% battery is left. No heating issues at all. The 120Hz refresh rate makes the viewing experience really smooth especially as compared to 60hz in the previous phone. The sound quality is good, speakers produce enough loud sound and movies and videos can be watched easily. Overall, a very good experience so far.",

												"0": "Worth every penny!",
												"1": "Pros: 1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust \"64MP\" or \"48MP\" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!! 2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh. 3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it. 4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone. 5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case. 6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable. 7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen. 8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers. 9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better. Cons: 1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great. 2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh. 3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones. Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher. Hope I helped 🙏",

I had ordered this device and I received a sealed package which had a faulty charger, I requested for a replacement and received a device which was a sealed box,  I am sure that the packaging is not as per company standards on the replacement device. After opening the box I noticed that: 1. The charger and the cable inside the box was not in the proper position inside the box. 2. the protective layer along the edges of the phone was missing, 3. the loudspeaker Audio output was not balanced, Audio on the earpiece side was low. 4. charger was emitting high frequency noise. I did not expect this from a seller like Appario retail pvt ltd, to fool the customer by providing a refurbished/repacking the phone. I wish the management is aware of all these malpractices.",

												"0": "Great phone, but sadly will be returning it.",
												"1": "The media could not be loaded. I'm glad I took a full length unboxing video. One should always do this no matter what! Sharing a clip from the entire 7-8 min video. Right after unboxing it, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the pre-applied screen protector which I intended to keep. Apart from that, it had a lot of dust particles on the front and back. This seems to be like a repackaged device, or it could genuinely be a packaging issue. Due to the scratches, there is rainbow effect in the affected portion of the screen. The rest of the device functions normally. I just hope I get a better piece on replacement that is flawless. Samsung really needs to work on the Q&A of their products. Now I will be waiting for the replacement to arrive, wasted weekend! This was supposed to be a gift for a loved one. Pros: Great Screen, love it at 120Hz. The dual stereo dolby atmos sound is kickass! Amazing camera, probably the best for 35-40k range. Nothing comes even close, including the shoddy marketing that chinese manufactures do by advertising \"108MP\" cameras and manufacturers like One Plus providing gimmicky lenses that do nothing at all if you know a bit of photography. Battery seems to be good. In the 10-15 minutes I tested to see how visible the scuffs are in videos etc, the drop was just about a percent OneUI 3 has come a long way! Really fantastic. Hoping 4 will be even better, and I am from the Apple eco-system since the past 7-8 years. The buttons are tactile and functional. Cons: The UI, while being amazing, can get overwhelming for people switching from OP or from stock android devices, but the extra settings are just a cherry on top once you spend time and know what each of them do and how much you can customize this phone to be uniquely yours. The included 15W charger is a major downer... especially for a phone with an MRP of INR 74,000/- even though it was down to 37k in sale. Not acceptable, early adopters from last year would have been really mad at this cheap move by Samsung. I really wish Samsung introduces an adaptive mode for the screen. I'm sure at 120Hz this will eat into the battery and 60Hz is too slow. Can't go back to 60 once you experience 120. I might have missed out on few pointers but will update the review once the replacement arrives. For now it's at 2 stars.",

												"0": "Great phone with the flagship features that actually matter to the everyday user!",
												"1": "Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020. Software: - One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful. - Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook. - 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip. Hardware: - Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel. - Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp. - Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine. - Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12. - IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9. - Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9. - Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle. - GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future. Battery Life: - With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming. Price: - While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone. - Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead. Final Verdict: It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.",

Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"1": "I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket. I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone. Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k. All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price. And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents. Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup. For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed. Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare \"warming\" from this phone. One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option. I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India. For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day. P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you. In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake. P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well! Just google Samsung EE-UC10JUWEGIN",

												"1": "In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion. I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.",

So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued. However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford. So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly. After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k. I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering. It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time. The camera quality is good, see some samples. The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot. The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it. Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations. Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference. Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all. I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time. Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other. If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also. Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life.

												"1": "Pros: 1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust \"64MP\" or \"48MP\" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!! 2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh. 3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it. 4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone. 5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case. 6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable. 7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen. 8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers. 9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better. Cons: 1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great. 2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh. 3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones. Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher. Hope I helped 🙏",

												"10": "pros 1. im a photographer so this matters to me. this phone has an amazing camera. im so glad i chose this phone over the oneplus 9r due to the telephoto lens. the 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. please forget about the number of megapixels and all never trust 64mp or 48mp to be a good camera due to just these numbers. average user or photographer you will definitely enjoy this camera. even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that im unable to focus on with my own eyes 2. 120hz amoled screen by samsung. its as gorgeous as i expected. and the notch is pretty small too not distracting at all tbh. 3. one ui. i used to think one ui was ok nothing great but after seeing one ui 3.1 which it comes with my viewpoint changed. its such a beautiful smooth and simple ui. and the upcoming one ui 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so youll just love it. 4. updates. youll get 3 years of android updates and thats great for a 40000 phone. 5. build quality. it may look simple but once you hold it it just feels premium. the cold aluminium and the compact backside it just feels great every time i remove the case. 6. the performance is also really good. you dont really need a snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. gaming video editing it will do it fast and well. and not much heating just slightly warm while playing games almost unnoticable. 7. ip68 rating. you can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen. 8. this may sound dumb but i appreciate the slower 15w charger because a its not that slow and b it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you dont use a super fast charger. the capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers. 9. the stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. even music can be easily enjoyed on it theres good bass and all. and if youre in a quiet room even better. cons 1. the battery life is honestly not that great. its not horrible but i expected better. even with battery saver im not getting much. but its not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good its just not great. 2. haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. but this is kind of a nitpick since it doesnt make a huge difference tbh. 3. lack of headphone jack. using a dongle just gives me less quality and its a bit annoying to carry around. and wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphonesearphones. overall im just really happy with this phone and im very glad i got it. and if youre considering s21fe just skip it. theres honestly no real difference and the price is 14000 higher. hope i helped",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. I'm glad I took a full length unboxing video. One should always do this no matter what! Sharing a clip from the entire 7-8 min video. Right after unboxing it, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the pre-applied screen protector which I intended to keep. Apart from that, it had a lot of dust particles on the front and back. This seems to be like a repackaged device, or it could genuinely be a packaging issue. Due to the scratches, there is rainbow effect in the affected portion of the screen. The rest of the device functions normally. I just hope I get a better piece on replacement that is flawless. Samsung really needs to work on the Q&A of their products. Now I will be waiting for the replacement to arrive, wasted weekend! This was supposed to be a gift for a loved one. Pros: Great Screen, love it at 120Hz. The dual stereo dolby atmos sound is kickass! Amazing camera, probably the best for 35-40k range. Nothing comes even close, including the shoddy marketing that chinese manufactures do by advertising \"108MP\" cameras and manufacturers like One Plus providing gimmicky lenses that do nothing at all if you know a bit of photography. Battery seems to be good. In the 10-15 minutes I tested to see how visible the scuffs are in videos etc, the drop was just about a percent OneUI 3 has come a long way! Really fantastic. Hoping 4 will be even better, and I am from the Apple eco-system since the past 7-8 years. The buttons are tactile and functional. Cons: The UI, while being amazing, can get overwhelming for people switching from OP or from stock android devices, but the extra settings are just a cherry on top once you spend time and know what each of them do and how much you can customize this phone to be uniquely yours. The included 15W charger is a major downer... especially for a phone with an MRP of INR 74,000/- even though it was down to 37k in sale. Not acceptable, early adopters from last year would have been really mad at this cheap move by Samsung. I really wish Samsung introduces an adaptive mode for the screen. I'm sure at 120Hz this will eat into the battery and 60Hz is too slow. Can't go back to 60 once you experience 120. I might have missed out on few pointers but will update the review once the replacement arrives. For now it's at 2 stars.",

												"1": "Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020. Software: - One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful. - Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook. - 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip. Hardware: - Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel. - Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp. - Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine. - Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12. - IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9. - Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9. - Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle. - GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future. Battery Life: - With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming. Price: - While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone. - Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead. Final Verdict: It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3.

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product.

However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"1": "I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket. I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone. Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k. All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price. And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents. Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup. For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed. Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare \"warming\" from this phone. One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option. I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India. For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day. P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you. In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake. P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well!

												"1": "In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion. I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.",

So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued. However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford. So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly. After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k. I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering. It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time. The camera quality is good, see some samples. The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot. The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it. Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations. Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference. Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all. I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time. Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other. If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also. Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life.

												"1": "Pros: 1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust \"64MP\" or \"48MP\" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!! 2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh. 3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it. 4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone. 5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case. 6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable. 7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen. 8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers. 9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better. Cons: 1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great. 2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh. 3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones. Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher. Hope I helped 🙏",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. I'm glad I took a full length unboxing video. One should always do this no matter what! Sharing a clip from the entire 7-8 min video. Right after unboxing it, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the pre-applied screen protector which I intended to keep. Apart from that, it had a lot of dust particles on the front and back. This seems to be like a repackaged device, or it could genuinely be a packaging issue. Due to the scratches, there is rainbow effect in the affected portion of the screen. The rest of the device functions normally. I just hope I get a better piece on replacement that is flawless. Samsung really needs to work on the Q&A of their products. Now I will be waiting for the replacement to arrive, wasted weekend! This was supposed to be a gift for a loved one. Pros: Great Screen, love it at 120Hz. The dual stereo dolby atmos sound is kickass! Amazing camera, probably the best for 35-40k range. Nothing comes even close, including the shoddy marketing that chinese manufactures do by advertising \"108MP\" cameras and manufacturers like One Plus providing gimmicky lenses that do nothing at all if you know a bit of photography. Battery seems to be good. In the 10-15 minutes I tested to see how visible the scuffs are in videos etc, the drop was just about a percent OneUI 3 has come a long way! Really fantastic. Hoping 4 will be even better, and I am from the Apple eco-system since the past 7-8 years. The buttons are tactile and functional. Cons: The UI, while being amazing, can get overwhelming for people switching from OP or from stock android devices, but the extra settings are just a cherry on top once you spend time and know what each of them do and how much you can customize this phone to be uniquely yours. The included 15W charger is a major downer... especially for a phone with an MRP of INR 74,000/- even though it was down to 37k in sale. Not acceptable, early adopters from last year would have been really mad at this cheap move by Samsung. I really wish Samsung introduces an adaptive mode for the screen. I'm sure at 120Hz this will eat into the battery and 60Hz is too slow. Can't go back to 60 once you experience 120. I might have missed out on few pointers but will update the review once the replacement arrives. For now it's at 2 stars.",

												"1": "Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020. Software: - One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful. - Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook. - 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip. Hardware: - Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel. - Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp. - Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine. - Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12. - IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9. - Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9. - Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle. - GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future. Battery Life: - With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming. Price: - While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone. - Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead. Final Verdict: It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.",

												"0": "Good mid- ranger phone",
												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

												"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"10": "i have been using this phone for a month i am a medium heavy user so ive written the review accordingly 1 display display is good for the price its bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough overall a good display my only problem is with the usage of gorilla glass 3 on the display it does come with a screen guard pre installed 2 battery life at 120hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage 2 3 hours of social media 1 2 hours of youtube etc it lasted till evening and i had to charge my phone before dinner at 60hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime so i do get 6 7 hours of screen on time which is good enough you also have features like sleep and deep sleep where the apps you dont use much goes to sleep and apps which you dont use for days goes to deep sleep for more info please google on this the display is locked on 120hz refresh rate and its not adaptive i wish it was adaptive that way battery could last longer at 120hz refresh rate too 3 camera camera is really good and you can use gcam without rooting i have attached a few pictures i took in the past few days the observation i had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app this is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise its not that visible unless you zoom in so its ok no big deal the colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that 4 software you can find a lot of videos on oneui hidden features how to make fingerprint sensor faster etc on youtube easily overall oneui is good there are bixby routines which were new for me but now i use it daily also they promise 3 years of android version updates and 4 years of android security updates so youre good for 3 4 years 5 processor i bought the 5g version with snapdragon processor i played games alot and it didnt heat up as much so thumbs up for that gaming mode is good as well in software front it also consumes less battery so thats good too there are also more number of 5g bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price so ya overall its a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what i wanted i wanted a phone number which does everything and i didnt want it to be good in just one department and lack in others my only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader its really low and also the silver ring around the front camera but i think ill get used to it soon hope this review helps you in decision peace",

												"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

												"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"10": "i have been using this phone for a month i am a medium heavy user so ive written the review accordingly 1 display display is good for the price its bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough overall a good display my only problem is with the usage of gorilla glass 3 on the display it does come with a screen guard pre installed 2 battery life at 120hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage 2 3 hours of social media 1 2 hours of youtube etc it lasted till evening and i had to charge my phone before dinner at 60hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime so i do get 6 7 hours of screen on time which is good enough you also have features like sleep and deep sleep where the apps you dont use much goes to sleep and apps which you dont use for days goes to deep sleep for more info please google on this the display is locked on 120hz refresh rate and its not adaptive i wish it was adaptive that way battery could last longer at 120hz refresh rate too 3 camera camera is really good and you can use gcam without rooting i have attached a few pictures i took in the past few days the observation i had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app this is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise its not that visible unless you zoom in so its ok no big deal the colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that 4 software you can find a lot of videos on oneui hidden features how to make fingerprint sensor faster etc on youtube easily overall oneui is good there are bixby routines which were new for me but now i use it daily also they promise 3 years of android version updates and 4 years of android security updates so youre good for 3 4 years 5 processor i bought the 5g version with snapdragon processor i played games alot and it didnt heat up as much so thumbs up for that gaming mode is good as well in software front it also consumes less battery so thats good too there are also more number of 5g bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price so ya overall its a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what i wanted i wanted a phone number which does everything and i didnt want it to be good in just one department and lack in others my only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader its really low and also the silver ring around the front camera but i think ill get used to it soon hope this review helps you in decision peace",

												"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"0": "Good mid- ranger phone",
												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

												"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"0": "VFM Flagship phone from Samsung",
												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "Good mid- ranger phone",
												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

												"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"10": "i have been using this phone for a month i am a medium heavy user so ive written the review accordingly 1 display display is good for the price its bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough overall a good display my only problem is with the usage of gorilla glass 3 on the display it does come with a screen guard pre installed 2 battery life at 120hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage 2 3 hours of social media 1 2 hours of youtube etc it lasted till evening and i had to charge my phone before dinner at 60hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime so i do get 6 7 hours of screen on time which is good enough you also have features like sleep and deep sleep where the apps you dont use much goes to sleep and apps which you dont use for days goes to deep sleep for more info please google on this the display is locked on 120hz refresh rate and its not adaptive i wish it was adaptive that way battery could last longer at 120hz refresh rate too 3 camera camera is really good and you can use gcam without rooting i have attached a few pictures i took in the past few days the observation i had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app this is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise its not that visible unless you zoom in so its ok no big deal the colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that 4 software you can find a lot of videos on oneui hidden features how to make fingerprint sensor faster etc on youtube easily overall oneui is good there are bixby routines which were new for me but now i use it daily also they promise 3 years of android version updates and 4 years of android security updates so youre good for 3 4 years 5 processor i bought the 5g version with snapdragon processor i played games alot and it didnt heat up as much so thumbs up for that gaming mode is good as well in software front it also consumes less battery so thats good too there are also more number of 5g bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price so ya overall its a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what i wanted i wanted a phone number which does everything and i didnt want it to be good in just one department and lack in others my only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader its really low and also the silver ring around the front camera but i think ill get used to it soon hope this review helps you in decision peace",

Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"1": "I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket. I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone. Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k. All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price. And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents. Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup. For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed. Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare \"warming\" from this phone. One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option. I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India. For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day. P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you. In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake. P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well!

												"1": "In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion. I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.",

So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued. However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford. So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly. After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k. I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering. It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time. The camera quality is good, see some samples. The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot. The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it. Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations. Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference. Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all. I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time. Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other. If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also. Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life.

Most of the time is spent on calling including Whatsapp (3-4 hours) and watching serials (5-6) hours and general net surfing (2-3 hours). Once charged in the morning, till night still 30% battery is left. No heating issues at all. The 120Hz refresh rate makes the viewing experience really smooth especially as compared to 60hz in the previous phone.

												"1": "Pros: 1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust \"64MP\" or \"48MP\" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!! 2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh. 3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it. 4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone. 5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case. 6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable. 7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen. 8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers. 9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better. Cons: 1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great. 2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh. 3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones. Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher. Hope I helped 🙏",

The charger and the cable inside the box was not in the proper position inside the box. 2. the protective layer along the edges of the phone was missing, 3. the loudspeaker Audio output was not balanced, Audio on the earpiece side was low. 4. charger was emitting high frequency noise.

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. I'm glad I took a full length unboxing video. One should always do this no matter what! Sharing a clip from the entire 7-8 min video. Right after unboxing it, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the pre-applied screen protector which I intended to keep. Apart from that, it had a lot of dust particles on the front and back. This seems to be like a repackaged device, or it could genuinely be a packaging issue. Due to the scratches, there is rainbow effect in the affected portion of the screen. The rest of the device functions normally. I just hope I get a better piece on replacement that is flawless. Samsung really needs to work on the Q&A of their products. Now I will be waiting for the replacement to arrive, wasted weekend! This was supposed to be a gift for a loved one. Pros: Great Screen, love it at 120Hz. The dual stereo dolby atmos sound is kickass! Amazing camera, probably the best for 35-40k range. Nothing comes even close, including the shoddy marketing that chinese manufactures do by advertising \"108MP\" cameras and manufacturers like One Plus providing gimmicky lenses that do nothing at all if you know a bit of photography. Battery seems to be good. In the 10-15 minutes I tested to see how visible the scuffs are in videos etc, the drop was just about a percent OneUI 3 has come a long way! Really fantastic. Hoping 4 will be even better, and I am from the Apple eco-system since the past 7-8 years. The buttons are tactile and functional. Cons: The UI, while being amazing, can get overwhelming for people switching from OP or from stock android devices, but the extra settings are just a cherry on top once you spend time and know what each of them do and how much you can customize this phone to be uniquely yours. The included 15W charger is a major downer... especially for a phone with an MRP of INR 74,000/- even though it was down to 37k in sale. Not acceptable, early adopters from last year would have been really mad at this cheap move by Samsung. I really wish Samsung introduces an adaptive mode for the screen. I'm sure at 120Hz this will eat into the battery and 60Hz is too slow. Can't go back to 60 once you experience 120. I might have missed out on few pointers but will update the review once the replacement arrives. For now it's at 2 stars.",

												"1": "Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020. Software: - One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful. - Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook. - 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip. Hardware: - Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel. - Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp. - Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine. - Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12. - IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9. - Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9. - Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle. - GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future. Battery Life: - With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming. Price: - While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone. - Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead. Final Verdict: It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

												"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

												"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
												"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

												"10": "i have been using this phone for a month i am a medium heavy user so ive written the review accordingly 1 display display is good for the price its bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough overall a good display my only problem is with the usage of gorilla glass 3 on the display it does come with a screen guard pre installed 2 battery life at 120hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage 2 3 hours of social media 1 2 hours of youtube etc it lasted till evening and i had to charge my phone before dinner at 60hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime so i do get 6 7 hours of screen on time which is good enough you also have features like sleep and deep sleep where the apps you dont use much goes to sleep and apps which you dont use for days goes to deep sleep for more info please google on this the display is locked on 120hz refresh rate and its not adaptive i wish it was adaptive that way battery could last longer at 120hz refresh rate too 3 camera camera is really good and you can use gcam without rooting i have attached a few pictures i took in the past few days the observation i had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app this is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise its not that visible unless you zoom in so its ok no big deal the colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that 4 software you can find a lot of videos on oneui hidden features how to make fingerprint sensor faster etc on youtube easily overall oneui is good there are bixby routines which were new for me but now i use it daily also they promise 3 years of android version updates and 4 years of android security updates so youre good for 3 4 years 5 processor i bought the 5g version with snapdragon processor i played games alot and it didnt heat up as much so thumbs up for that gaming mode is good as well in software front it also consumes less battery so thats good too there are also more number of 5g bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price so ya overall its a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what i wanted i wanted a phone number which does everything and i didnt want it to be good in just one department and lack in others my only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader its really low and also the silver ring around the front camera but i think ill get used to it soon hope this review helps you in decision peace",

Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

												"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

												"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

												"1": "I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket. I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone. Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k. All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price. And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents. Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup. For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed. Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare \"warming\" from this phone. One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option. I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India. For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day. P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you. In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake. P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well!

												"1": "In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion. I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.",

So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued. However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford. So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly. After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k. I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering. It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time. The camera quality is good, see some samples. The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot. The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it. Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations. Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference. Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all. I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time. Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other. If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also. Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life.

This phone has AR zone app. You can play with augmented reality models. And much more. Only one cons - Battery life is average.

While initiating and data transfer, did get a little hot but nothing post that. Most of the time is spent on calling including Whatsapp (3-4 hours) and watching serials (5-6) hours and general net surfing (2-3 hours). Once charged in the morning, till night still 30% battery is left. No heating issues at all. The 120Hz refresh rate makes the viewing experience really smooth especially as compared to 60hz in the previous phone. The sound quality is good, speakers produce enough loud sound and movies and videos can be watched easily. Overall, a very good experience so far.",

												"1": "Pros: 1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust \"64MP\" or \"48MP\" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!! 2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh. 3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it. 4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone. 5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case. 6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable. 7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen. 8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers. 9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better. Cons: 1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great. 2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh. 3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones. Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher. Hope I helped 🙏",

												"1": "The media could not be loaded. I'm glad I took a full length unboxing video. One should always do this no matter what! Sharing a clip from the entire 7-8 min video. Right after unboxing it, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the pre-applied screen protector which I intended to keep. Apart from that, it had a lot of dust particles on the front and back. This seems to be like a repackaged device, or it could genuinely be a packaging issue. Due to the scratches, there is rainbow effect in the affected portion of the screen. The rest of the device functions normally. I just hope I get a better piece on replacement that is flawless. Samsung really needs to work on the Q&A of their products. Now I will be waiting for the replacement to arrive, wasted weekend! This was supposed to be a gift for a loved one. Pros: Great Screen, love it at 120Hz. The dual stereo dolby atmos sound is kickass! Amazing camera, probably the best for 35-40k range. Nothing comes even close, including the shoddy marketing that chinese manufactures do by advertising \"108MP\" cameras and manufacturers like One Plus providing gimmicky lenses that do nothing at all if you know a bit of photography. Battery seems to be good. In the 10-15 minutes I tested to see how visible the scuffs are in videos etc, the drop was just about a percent OneUI 3 has come a long way! Really fantastic. Hoping 4 will be even better, and I am from the Apple eco-system since the past 7-8 years. The buttons are tactile and functional. Cons: The UI, while being amazing, can get overwhelming for people switching from OP or from stock android devices, but the extra settings are just a cherry on top once you spend time and know what each of them do and how much you can customize this phone to be uniquely yours. The included 15W charger is a major downer... especially for a phone with an MRP of INR 74,000/- even though it was down to 37k in sale. Not acceptable, early adopters from last year would have been really mad at this cheap move by Samsung. I really wish Samsung introduces an adaptive mode for the screen. I'm sure at 120Hz this will eat into the battery and 60Hz is too slow. Can't go back to 60 once you experience 120. I might have missed out on few pointers but will update the review once the replacement arrives. For now it's at 2 stars.",

												"1": "Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020. Software: - One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful. - Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook. - 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip. Hardware: - Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel. - Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp. - Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine. - Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12. - IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9. - Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9. - Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle. - GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future. Battery Life: - With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming. Price: - While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone. - Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead. Final Verdict: It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.",
