										"0": "Good mid- ranger phone",
										"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

										"1": "I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

										"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

										"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

										"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
										"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

										"1": "Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store: 1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option. 2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

										"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

										"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
										"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

										"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

										"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",

Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

										"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

										"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

										"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers. 3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good. 4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging. 5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well. 6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9. 7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch. 8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9. 9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9. 10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger. Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",

Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone. Pros: 1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above. 2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want. 3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers.. 4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though. Cons: 1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal. 2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though. 3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better. 4. Fingerprint reader could have been better. Edit: OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.",

										"1": "Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Will divide this review into pros and cons. First, the Pros: 1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience. 2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously. . I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products. 3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great. 4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point. 5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately. 6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience. 7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. 8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing. 9.5G ready with 9 5g bands. Cons: 1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range. 2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times. 3.Average front camera. Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",

										"1": "The media could not be loaded. The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference. I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity. Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me. This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio. After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller \"Prime Benefit\". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",

										"0": "It is really good at everything, just not the best.",
										"1": "I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly. 1) Display Display is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed. 2) Battery life At 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this. The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too. 3) Camera Camera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that. 4) Software You can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years. 5) Processor I bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya. Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others. My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.",

										"1": "The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities. If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks. I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",

										"1": "Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use. Well the major pros: 1. Look wise the phone is awesome. 2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome 3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references: a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is. b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection. d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great. 4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India. 5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast. 6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint. 7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless. 8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this 9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification. 10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it. Cons: 1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge. 2. Wireless charging is also not that fast. 3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends. I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",
